## TensorFlow.js Progressive Web App

This is a web application where users can classify images selected locally or taken with their
device's camera. The app uses TensorFlow.js and a pre-trained model converted to the TensorFlow.js
format to provide the inference capabilities. This model is saved locally in the browser using
IndexedDB. A service worker is also used to provide offline capabilities.
